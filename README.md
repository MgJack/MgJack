Hi! My name is MgJack. I am willing to solve the problems. Now I'm currently learning Java SE and I'm planning to learn Java EE, Python and other backend languages.
I want to become a backend developer and my dream is to become a data analyst. Whe I searched and read about other successful programmers, they started to become a developer whether they were interested in or not. After 3-10 years of experience in that field, they changed their career based on their interests. Then, they became ease in learning new things because of the work experience in the previous field. That's why I want to become a backend developer at first.
